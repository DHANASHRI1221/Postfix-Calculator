ðŸš€ Reverse Polish Notation Calculator Project ðŸš€
Overview
Welcome to the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator project! This project showcases a versatile calculator implementation, utilizing three distinct stack structures:

Part (a): Fixed Size Array Stacks
Part (b): Dynamically Sized Array Stacks
Part (c): Doubly Linked List Stacks
In Each part introduced advancements in handling the stack data structure, catering to different needs and scenarios.

Features:

âœ¨ Part (a): Stacks using Fixed Size Arrays
Efficient stack operations with a fixed-size array.
Standard mathematical operations and additional commands.


âœ¨ Part (b): Stacks using Dynamically Sized Arrays
Flexible stack management with dynamically sized arrays.
Enhanced adaptability for varying data loads.


âœ¨ Part (c): Stacks using Doubly Linked Lists
Dynamic stack implementation using doubly linked lists.
Explored an alternative approach to managing the stack.


Usage:
Evaluate the correctness of the implementation by creating instances of the Stack class and invoking its member functions.
